# what type of coordinate reference system (World Geodetic System 1984 aka WGS84 aka EPSG 4326 - same as what's used in GPS)
# remember this number: EPSG 4326
st_crs(world)

# Explanations for +proj vs +datum vs +ellps
# datum tells you how to map a coordinate (lat/long) to a sphere
# ellipsoid tells you the shape of the sphere
# projection transforms the sphere to a flat surface
# towgs84 is for data transformations, in case you need an additional step to get from your data to wgs84
# all of these parameters make up your "Corrdinate Reference System" CRS
# different combinations are better for local vs global representations (show example)
# this is also all complicated by the fact that plate tectonics are shifting everything in different directions
# different combinations of datum + ellipsoid + projection can be set with an EPSG number (European Petroleum Survey Group); the one we have is EPSG 4326, the standard one used in GPS (WGS 84)
# can set/reset all of these parameters but today we'll just modify the "projection" part
# list of different types of projections and their aliases (you'll need this for your code): https://proj.org/operations/projections/
